# UK public HPC knowledge base

*Andy Turner, EPCC, The University of Edinburgh*

In this blog post I consider how we (as the UK HPC community) could go about creating a 
community HPC knowledge base that would allow us to share and reuse useful technical 
information. Much of these thoughts came out of discussions at the HPC Champions meeting
that took place on 16 September 2019 alongside the UK RSE Conference in Birmingham, UK.

## Motivation

The UK HPC landscape has changed a lot over the past 5 years with the introduction of the EPSRC
national Tier-2 HPC facilities to supplement the national supercomputing service, ARCHER, and
the DiRAC national HPC service. A lot of work has gone on to increase information and experience
sharing between the different national HPC services and to institutional HPC services with a large
amount of success. There are groups that successfully join together HPC systems technical staff, RSEs that 
support users and service management across the UK.

One question that has been raised within the current community meetings is: how can we share 
technical solutions and information that we have locally across the community and potentially
publicly to the wider HPC community (including users, RSEs and service providers)? Many services
and sites have internal knowledge bases (both private and public) that contain information that
would be useful across the community and one option would be to find a way to create a public
knowledge base that could be used by the community to expose this useful information.
   
## Requirements

What would the requirements for a public UK HPC knowledge base look like? Based on discussions 
at the HPC Champions meeting it should be:

   - Publicly visible through a web browser: available for anyone to view the information and 
     make use of it
   - Searchable and well-indexed: the most powerful search tools are internet search engines. The
     knowledge base should be well indexed and available to be found easily through standard
     search engines.
   - Permissions allow public addition of knowledge base entries: so all can contribute. This,
     however, means that we need a way to...
   - Rate answers based on correctness: to ensure that entries are kept up to date and that
     publicly-added entries are reviewed.
   - A single service/location to avoid the issues of fragmentation of information.
   
## Current situation and options

Currently, the useful information is stored in a number of different locations with different
access:

   - Internal knowledge bases, wikis and service desks. These systems do not allow public access to 
     the information and sometimes are even difficult to use internally to query information.
   - Public repositories and wikis. A number of different sites provide public repositories and wikis that cover
     particular technical aspects, such as compilation and installation instructions for different
     research software. Although useful, the information is fragmented and often difficult to
     find without knowing where it is.

There is actually a large amount of information already publicly available, for example:

   - Compilation instructions for different HPC systems
   - Isambard GW4 Arm compilation instructions
   - UCL build scripts
   - UK HPC benchmarks

Options to meet the requirements for the tool as described above include

   - Open tools: Stack Overflow, ask.cyberinfrastructure
   
## Next steps

   - Testing Stack Overflow
   - Examining ask.cyberinfrastructure (who is involved? what are activity levels like? quality of answers? user focussed or not?)
   
## Summary

   - Interesting opportunity
