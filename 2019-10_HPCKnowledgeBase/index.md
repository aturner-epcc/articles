# UK public HPC knowledge base

*Andy Turner, EPCC, The University of Edinburgh*

In this blog post I consider how we (as the UK HPC community) could go about creating a 
community HPC knowledge base that would allow us to share and reuse useful technical 
information. Much of these thoughts came out of discussions at the HPC Champions meeting
that took place on 16 September 2019 alongside the UK RSE Conference in Birmingham, UK.

## Motivation

The UK HPC landscape has changed a lot over the past 5 years with the introduction of the EPSRC
national Tier-2 HPC facilities to supplement the national supercomputing service, ARCHER, and
the DiRAC national HPC service. A lot of work has gone on to increase information and experience
sharing between the different national HPC services and to institutional HPC services with a large
amount of success. There are groups that successfully join together HPC systems technical staff, RSEs that 
support users and service management across the UK.

One question that has been raised within the current community meetings is: how can we share 
technical solutions and information that we have locally across the community and potentially
publicly to the wider HPC community (including users, RSEs and service providers)? Many services
and sites have internal knowledge bases that contain information that would be useful across the
community and one option would be to find a way to create a public knowledge base that could be 
used by the community to expose this useful information.
   
## Requirements

   - Publicly visible
   - Searchable and well-indexed
   - Add to by multiple people and/or organisations
   
## Landscape survey

   - Current: SAFE
   - Commercial products
   - Open tools: Stack Overflow, ask.cyberinfrastructure
   
## Next steps

   - Testing Stack Overflow
   - Examining ask.cyberinfrastructure (who is involved? what are activity levels like? quality of answers? user focussed or not?)
   
## Summary

   - Interesting opportunity
